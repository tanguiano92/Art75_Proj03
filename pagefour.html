    <h3>Description:<h3>
  <p>"We Are The Monsters" is a piece that was created as a reminder of how we as human
     beings are the creators of monsters in our world. Our history is riddled with despair, terror,
    and shadows and though we try to forget our past, it always comes back to haunt us.
    From infamous murderers to battered children bullying other children to the point of suicide,
    to trusting too much the ones we love, or assuming we are safe with them. Anything
    can happen to anyone at any given moment.
    All the components of this piece are limelights on the things humans have done in the past
    that has influenced our media (i.e. film ideas, stories, news and lore) but little to nothing
    is being done to prevent future tragedies. Instead we make them into TV specials or bestselling books.
    Like the popular story of the mentally ill husband (or mother, or child) that goes crazy and tries to
    murder his/her family that no one saw coming; or the doctor that was supposed to help those suffering
    from some terrible disease but instead mistreats their patients; the chiild being bullied at school and taking
    revenge into their own hands because no one would help them; and our habit of turning innocent figures into something
    unnerving and disturbing. People are afraid of the things they do not understand or can't see,
    but what they don't realize is our society and societal behavior creates the misunderstood and invisible threats.
    Therefore instead of hiding from it or pretending it does not exist, we need to take repsponsibility
    for the way we grow in our society. We need to put a stop to bullying, stop ignoring or downplaying mental
    illness, let innocence remain innocent, and help those in need.</p>
